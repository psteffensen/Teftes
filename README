Tetris Instructions:

Run tetris.py to run the game!

One or multiplayer!
Press UP to join the game
Once all players have joined, press DOWN to start the game

Workes with joypad (tested with SNES usb type joypad)

Use LEFT and RIGHT to move your shape, UP to rotate, and DOWN it to the bottom directly.
If you clear sevral lines at once, lines (or packages) will appear at the bottom of your opponent�s board. The number of packages depends on the number of players.
The blocks drop faster as players clear more lines.

When one player�s board reaches the top of the screen, they lose and the last player wins.

Press ESC to exit the program during a game.


Made by Peter Steffensen 2017. But...
Teftes was originally forked from "Burton-Conner-Tetris-Battle-master". Then I changed so much that I thought I was easier for all if I just uploaded it like a new project. So the original code was created by: Russell Cohen <rcoh@mit.edu> and Leah Alpert <lalpert@mit.edu>
